## Usage

This application is designed and implemented using React, JavaScript, JSX, and HTML, with styling handled through CSS.
It has consumed RESTful APIs to fetch and display dynamic data and added interactive features by integrating various backend endpoints.
It also incorporated React Router to manage navigation across multiple views and ensure smooth transitions between different sections of the application.
